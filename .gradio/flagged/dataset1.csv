### Answer:
cache.set(""result"", compute_expensive_result())

This will return the cache result for the current time, which is cached by the application.

It is also possible to use cache.set() to set the cache cache-specific value.

To use cache.set() to set the cache cache-specific value, you must first run the following command:

cache.set(cache_cache_cache_value, cache_cache_cache_value)

This will return the cache cache-specific value for the current time.

This is a bit more complex and can be difficult to understand, so it is recommended to read this document carefully.
